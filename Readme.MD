"""This was a machine learning project for text analytics and classification. The objective was to find the most important keywords 
associated with whether a protection agreement was sold to the customer or not during the sale of appliances. The data is chats between 
sales representatives and customers online. I achieved the goals using scikit-learn ML algorithms. I can't upload the actual data I used 
because of an NDA. I pre-processed the text using Pandas and regular expressions. Then I used 4 different algorithms to compare 
performance and in the end decided on logistic regression. The algorithms were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, 
Support Vector Machines with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Perceptron. The structure of the data used was:

Protection Agreement bought? (0/1)		Order ID		Chat
0/1										ID 1			LINE 1
0/1										ID 1			LINE 2
0/1										ID 1			LINE 3
